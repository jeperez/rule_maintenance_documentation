Business Rule Maintenance Tool -Documentation

Documentation for the Business Rules Maintenance web application

The Business Rules Maintenance web application is a tool to compose business rules and orchestrate them. Multiple rules build the logic than can be used to check, validate, filter or update data.

The web application exports a collection of rules into a zip file which then in turn can be directly be run with JaRE - the Java Rule Engine. JaRE is written in Java and can be used in any Java based tool or language, embedded in other applications or also web applications.

There is a plugin available for the Pentaho ETL tool. This allows to seperate business logic from the IT code and thus enahnces quality, cleanness of code and establishes a proper division of responsibilities between bsuiness users and IT.

JaRE is lightweight and runs either standalone or as a server.

The documentation helps the user to get started, do administrative tasks, handle updates to underlying software and shows the concepts and workflows of the tool.
