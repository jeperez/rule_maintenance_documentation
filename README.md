Documentation for the Business Rules Maintenance web application

The Business Rules Maintenance web application is a tool to define business rules and orchestrate them. Multiple rules build the logic than can be used to check, validate, filter or update data.

The web application exports a collection of rules into a zip file which then in turn can be directly be run with JaRE - the Java Rule Engine. JaRE is written in Java and can be used in any Java based tool or language, embedded in other applications or also web applications. JaRE is lightweight and runs either standalone on as a server.

The documentation shall help the user to get started, do administrative tasks, handle updates to underlying software and show the concepts and workflows of the tool.
