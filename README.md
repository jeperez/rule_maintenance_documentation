Business Rule Maintenance Tool - Documentation

Documentation for the Business Rules Maintenance web application

The Business Rules Maintenance web application is a tool to compose business rules and orchestrate them. Multiple rules build the logic than can be used to check, validate, filter or update data.

The web application exports a collection of rules into a zip file which then in turn can be directly be run with JaRE - the Java Rule Engine. JaRE is written in Java and can be used in any Java based tool or language, embedded in other applications or also web applications.

There is a plugin available for the Pentaho ETL tool. This allows to seperate business logic from the IT code and thus enhances quality, cleanness of code and establishes a proper division of responsibilities between business users and IT.

There is a processor available for Apache Nifi.  This allows to seperate business logic from the IT code and thus enhances quality, cleanness of code and establishes a proper division of responsibilities between business users and IT.

JaRE is lightweight and runs either standalone or as a server.

The documentation helps the user to get started, do administrative tasks, handle updates to underlying software and shows the concepts and workflows of the tool.

The documentation also contains instructions how to install the Business Rules Maintenance Tool.
